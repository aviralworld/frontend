  <h2>About the project</h2>
  <p>
    As humans, we have the innate desire to be connected with each other. Our
    lives and stories are deeply entangled, interdependent and strongly
    intertwined. As never before, in this historical moment we are understanding
    the deeper meaning of this. Human closeness and relations in centuries has
    been forged and build on shared experiences and knowledges. Storytelling and
    story-sharing appeared in various forms since the presence of humanity on
    this earth; from the drawings of our early ancestors on caves, to gestures,
    to oral and written transmission of stories.
  </p>
  <p>
    The current pandemic is depriving us of the freedom and spontaneity in which
    stories are shared and repetitive narratives are now originated mainly in
    the mass media or shared in the social media, which follows predetermined
    rules, editing and scripts. This project, however, wants to provide an
    intangible space, where oral transmission of different stories and
    narratives are entitled to overlap and connect to generate a network.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this moment, all of us are deprived of opportunities to explore new
    places and meet people, as many of us are currently experiencing some forms
    of lockdown and social distancing. This lack of exposure to new ideas and
    stories was one of the driving forces behind this project: what if, through
    interconnected stories, we could experience that sense of exploration whilst
    staying indoors? Just because we are physically confined to one location
    does not mean we have to let go of our desire to explore and discover new
    things.
  </p>
  <p>
    Disregarding national borders, stories can connect people rapidly,
    unexpectedly, and maybe even unwantedly—just like a virus contaminates us
    and creates networks between people. Given that the current pandemic has
    created a lot of anxiety, grief, disbelief, and fear, with this project, we
    want to remind people that not everything that is connected to viruses is
    bad. Granted, the impact of the COVID-19 virus is beyond anything the world
    has seen in a long time, but, for a moment, leave those things aside and
    think about the pace with which the virus has brought humanity together.
    This interconnectedness of people is something we want to highlight and
    celebrate with this project.
  </p>
  <p>
    To take part in this project you are asked to share an audio recording of a
    meaningful story of yours related to the COVID-19 virus. Each story is
    connected to a thread and has an initiator—someone who started the
    thread—but please feel free to explore connections between different
    threads, connecting different people and different experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    This initiative was created by a team of professionals currently residing in
    Germany, India, and the UAE:
  </p>
  <ul class="team">
    <li>Alessia Cadamuro</li>
    <li>Gionata Gatto</li>
    <li>Shiv Jha-Mathur</li>
    <li>Miikka J. Lehtonen</li>
    <li>Leonard Lutz</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Our background is in design, philosophy, software development, and
    management, and we were drawn to this topic by curiosity. At first, we were
    thinking about how the global lockdown might create tensions in households,
    thus creating a need for people to vent their frustrations somehow. After a
    couple of discussions, however, we quickly realized asking people to share
    with us audio recordings of them talking about their frustrations would
    result in voyeurism, which is why we shifted our focus.
